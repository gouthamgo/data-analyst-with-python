# Loading a DataFrame
We're still working hard to solve the kidnapping of Bayes, the Golden Retriever. Previously, we used a license plate spotted at the crime scene to narrow the list of suspects to:

- Fred Frequentist
- Ronald Aylmer Fisher
- Gertrude Cox
- Kirstine Smith

We've obtained credit card records for all four suspects. Perhaps some of them made suspicious purchases before the kidnapping?

The records are in a CSV called "credit_records.csv".

# Instructions

- Import the pandas module under the alias pd.
- Load the CSV "credit_records.csv" into a DataFrame called credit_records.
- Display the first five rows of credit_records using the .head() method.

# Script
```
# Import pandas under the alias pd
import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV "credit_records.csv"
credit_records = pd.read_csv('credit_records.csv')

# Display the first five rows of credit_records using the .head() method
print(credit_records.head())
```
# Output
```
