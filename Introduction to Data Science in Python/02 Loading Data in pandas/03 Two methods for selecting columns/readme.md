# Two methods for selecting columns
Once again, we've loaded the credit card records of our four suspects into a DataFrame called credit_records. Let's examine the items that they've purchased.

- The pandas module has been imported under the alias pd. The DataFrame credit_records has already been imported.


# Instructions 1/2

- Select the column item from credit_records using brackets and string notation.
- Select the column item from credit_records using dot notation.

# Script

## Select the column item from credit_records
## Use brackets and string notation
items = credit_records['item']

# Display the results
print(items)

## Select the column item from credit_records
## Use dot notation
items = credit_records.item

# Display the results
print(items)
```
