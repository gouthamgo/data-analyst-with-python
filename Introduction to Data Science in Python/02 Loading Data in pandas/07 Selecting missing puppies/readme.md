# Selecting missing puppies

- Let's return to our DataFrame of missing puppies, which is loaded as mpr. Let's select a few different rows to learn more about the other missing dogs.

#Instructions
```
Select the dogs where Age is greater than 2.
Select the dogs whose Status is equal to Still Missing.
Select all dogs whose Dog Breed is not equal to Poodle.
```
# Script

# Select the dogs where Age is greater than 2
greater_than_2 = mpr[mpr.Age > 2]
print(greater_than_2)

# Select the dogs whose Status is equal to Still Missing
still_missing = mpr[mpr['Status'] == 'Still Missing']
print(still_missing)

# Select all dogs whose Dog Breed is not equal to Poodle
not_poodle = mpr[mpr['Dog Breed'] != 'Poodle']
print(not_poodle)
```
